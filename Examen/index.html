    <p class="description">Welcome! This tool allows you to explore & interact with a hierarchical graph representation of the Steam Store games (inside the left window).
       You can use your mouse to navigate around & zoom in/out, as well as check the information on each node by hovering over it.
        Clicking on one of the nodes will advance the graph to the next level in the hierarchy, and right-clicking anywhere will move it back to the previous level.
       In the last level of the hierarchy you'll find all the games that are contained in your chosen path, and by clicking them they'll be added to your list (located further down to the right).
       Finally, you can search for games & locate them easily by using the search system down below.</p>
